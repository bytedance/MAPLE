# MAPLE: Methylation Anchor Probe for Low-signal Enrichment

---

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](./README_zh.md)

## Introduction

**MAPLE** (Methylation-Anchor Probe for Low-Signal Enrichment) is a technology designed to enhance the detection of low-frequency, disease-specific methylation haplotypes. Traditional hybrid capture methods rely on long, unbiased probes and require extremely high sequencing depth, with most reads being uninformative. MAPLE instead uses rationally designed, ultra-sensitive short probes to selectively enrich these rare methylation haplotypes, achieving higher detection sensitivity while substantially reducing sequencing costs.

## Project Overview

MAPLE consists of four major components:

### 1. MAPLE-Probe Design
The MAPLE probe design module generates highly specific methylation-targeted probes for downstream enrichment and sequencing. It ensures both **sequence specificity** and **thermodynamic stability**.

**Key Steps:**
- **Generate haplotype sequences and DNA chains** (`MAPLE_sequence_generator.py`)  
  Constructs all possible haplotype sequences and corresponding DNA strands for the target regions.
- **Evaluate thermodynamic properties and QC** (`MAPLE_probe_thermodynamics.py`)  
  Filters probes based on melting temperature, GC content, and secondary structure to ensure optimal hybridization.
- **Detect off-target binding using BLASTN** (`MAPLE_parallel_blastn.py`)  
  Checks potential off-target sites against the genome to minimize non-specific binding.
- **Select best probes per haplotype** (`MAPLE_select_best_probe.py`)  
  Chooses probes with maximal specificity, coverage, and thermodynamic efficiency for each haplotype.

**Inputs:**  
- Target genomic coordinates (start/end positions)  
- Methylation haplotype status for the target region  

**Outputs:**  
- Qualified probe sequences optimized for specificity and thermodynamic stability

### 2. MAPLE TAS Data Processing & Haplotype Calling
This module processes targeted NGS sequencing data to quantify probe performance and call haplotype-specific methylation patterns.

**Key Steps:**
- **Full NGS pipeline** (`MAPLE_NGS.sh`)  
  Includes read trimming, alignment to reference genome, probe evaluation, and quality control.
- **Count on-target and haplotype fragments** (`haplo_fraction.sh`)  
  Calculates the number of captured fragments per probe and haplotype, enabling evaluation of enrichment efficiency.
- **Compute haplotype frequency ratios** (`MAPLE_cal_haplo_fraction.py`)  
  Determines the relative abundance of each haplotype, providing essential input for downstream classification and enrichment factor modeling.

**Inputs:**  
- Paired-end FASTQ files from MAPLE-captured sequencing  

**Outputs:**  
- Haplotype fragment counts per target  
- Haplotype fraction matrix for downstream analysis  

### 3. Enrichment Factor Model (EFM)
The Enrichment Factor Model quantifies **probe enrichment efficiency** across target regions. It evaluates how well methylation-specific probes capture the intended genomic loci relative to background noise.  

**Key Features:**
- Calculates on-target coverage for each probe  
- Computes haplotype-specific enrichment metrics  
- Supports quality control by identifying low-efficiency probes  
- Outputs numerical enrichment scores for probe optimization  

**Inputs:**  
- BED files of stitched fragments from MAPLE-Stitch  
- Reference haplotype methylation pattern definitions  

**Outputs:**  
- Per-probe enrichment factors  
- Summary statistics for on-target coverage and haplotype specificity  
- Intermediate files for QC and downstream analysis  

### 4. Boost-Tree Classifier
The Boost-tree Classifier uses **gradient-boosted trees (LightGBM)** to predict cancer or non-cancer status based on enriched methylation haplotypes. It leverages both probe-level enrichment scores and haplotype patterns as features.  

**Key Features:**
- Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters for maximal sensitivity at a given specificity  
- Supports stratified or random cross-validation for robust performance evaluation  
- Produces per-sample predictions with probability scores and optimal decision thresholds  
- Outputs sensitivity, specificity, and ROC-AUC metrics for validation and test datasets  

**Inputs:**  
- Probe enrichment scores from EFM  
- Sample metadata (e.g., labels, stratification features)  

**Outputs:**  
- Trained LightGBM model and optimized hyperparameters  
- Predicted probabilities and binary labels for train/validation/test sets  
- Performance metrics for evaluation (sensitivity, specificity, AUC)
